## Osint 3 (X solves)

In this challenge we have to find the days where this ship was in Sardinia.

### Solution

When you open the image you see a sailer with an Italian flag and "Amerigo Vespucci", so we know the name of the ship. Now we have to find the time period when it was in Sardinia having a clear time reference which is before Covid-19. With an accurate search on Google you can find a lot of news. In the description there is another hint "I think near Ichnusa" and if you type Ichnusa in Google Maps you see a lot of places but as it is a ship, it must be something near the sea. Cross-checking data between Ichnusa places and news of Amerigo Vespucci, you can find that Americo Vespucci was in Cagliari at Ichnusa dock from 21st to 23rd of June 2019.
