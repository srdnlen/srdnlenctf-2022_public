## Osint 2 (X solves)

In this challenge we have a lot of different pictures of a river (from the airplane) and a lake or river from the land. We have to find its name.

### Solution

If we put all the 5 pictures in Google Images we do not have a clear place but a lot of different results. Reading carefully the description it says that he/she was travelling between the big mountain range and the coast in Sardinia. So the first step is to find the area. Searching on Google "big mountain range sardinia" the first result is "Monti Gennargentu" which is quite near the coast but it is a very wide area with a lot of rivers and lakes. With a deep analysis of the map and the list of mountains, there is one called Supramonte, the third highest, from which flows a river called "cedrino". The images taken from the airplane are very similar to its course seen from Google Maps.
